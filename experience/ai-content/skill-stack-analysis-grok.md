Technical Skills
API Development and Management
Designed and developed API specifications (e.g., Snapshots API, Reddit endpoints).
Created and maintained Postman collections for API testing and documentation.
Implemented CRUD operations for various endpoints (e.g., product-research, Reddit raw data, Reddit Insights, Reddit Reports).
Deployed and tested API endpoints on production environments (e.g., Render.com).
Integrated authentication (bearer tokens) and user management with role-based permissions.
Developed API endpoints for generating reports (e.g., Share of Voice, Reddit Reports) and PDF generation.
Database Management
Designed and implemented MongoDB schemas for products, folders, prompts, and tasks.
Configured and set up MongoDB Atlas as the database service.
Managed database operations, including seeding test data and handling data integrity checks.
Implemented task scheduling and queueing systems in MongoDB (e.g., task collections for snapshot scheduling).
Backend Development
Built and deployed backend services using Node.js (inferred from context and common use with MongoDB and Vercel/Render).
Implemented backend logic for triggering no-code workflows (e.g., n8n, Reddit workflows).
Handled error management and logging with Sentry SDK integration.
Refactored code to remove unused files/comments and improve maintainability.
DevOps and Deployment
Deployed applications to Vercel and Render.com, transitioning from serverless to containerized web services.
Researched and planned CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments from GitHub to hosting platforms.
Set up health check monitors (e.g., Sentry Uptime Monitor) and explored Slack integration for real-time error notifications.
Managed deployment issues, such as fixing integration bugs when moving from development to production.
Workflow Automation
Integrated APIs with no-code platforms (e.g., n8n) for automated workflows like prompt generation and report creation.
Implemented task queueing systems with workers to execute tasks sequentially (e.g., snapshot generation).
Developed status-checking mechanisms for workflow completion.
Frontend Integration
Researched and evaluated open-source frontend UI solutions (e.g., Scira.app for deepResearcher).
Integrated backend APIs with frontend requirements, such as PDF generation for report delivery.
Testing and Quality Assurance
Wrote unit tests to improve code coverage.
Conducted general testing of API endpoints and workflows to identify and fix bugs.
Implemented error handling to ensure robust API performance.
Tested user access controls and folder permissions.
Data Processing and Reporting
Developed Share of Voice (SoV) and Reddit Insights reports, integrating data from multiple sources (e.g., Reddit workflows).
Processed and cleaned data to remove unwanted entries (e.g., empty strings, null values).
Experimented with Python packages for HTML-to-PDF conversion for report generation.
Third-Party Integrations
Integrated with external services like APITemplate.io for PDF generation.
Connected APIs with Reddit workflows for data scraping and insights generation.
Set up monitoring with Sentry and explored Apimonitor for health checks.
Programming and Tools
Proficient in Python (e.g., updating packages, experimenting with HTML-to-PDF libraries).
Used Postman for API specification and testing.
Familiar with Markdown for report generation and documentation.
Worked with Git for version control (inferred from CI/CD and GitHub references).
Soft Skills
Collaboration and Communication
Regularly collaborated with team members (e.g., Micha≈Ç, Adam, David) to gather feedback and refine requirements.
Presented project updates (e.g., deepResearcher demo to Bartosz) and aligned with stakeholders on project goals.
Documented work clearly in daily updates and API documentation for team reference.
Problem-Solving
Debugged complex issues, such as integration bugs during deployment and Reddit Insights data generation failures.
Researched and proposed solutions for queueing systems, user management, and CI/CD pipelines.
Addressed feedback-driven improvements (e.g., adjusting API schemas, fixing typos).
Time Management and Prioritization
Managed multiple concurrent tasks (e.g., API development, database design, deployment, and testing).
Provided clear next steps in daily updates, ensuring focus on critical tasks.
Adaptability
Switched hosting platforms (Vercel to Render.com) to address compute time limitations.
Iterated on API specifications and database schemas based on team feedback.
Experimented with new tools and approaches (e.g., APITemplate.io, Slack integration) to meet project needs.
Attention to Detail
Ensured proper error handling and data validation (e.g., removing null values, formatting SoV reports).
Created detailed API documentation and Postman collections for clarity and usability.
Tested endpoints thoroughly to ensure reliability before deployment.
Domain-Specific Knowledge
Search Engine and Data Scraping
Leveraged Reddit workflows for data scraping and integrated them into reports.
Utilized SERP (Search Engine Results Page) data for research and insights generation.
Product Research and Analytics
Built workflows for product research, including prompt generation and Share of Voice analysis.
Developed data models for product dimensions and research storage.
Social Media Integration
Integrated Reddit as a data source for insights and reports, handling raw data and user journey stages.
